# Graph Algorithms Project

This Java project implements:

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds the shortest paths from a source node.
- **Prim’s Algorithm**: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for undirected graphs.

---

## Input Format

Each graph file (e.g., `graph1.txt`) follows this format:
<Nodes> <Edges> <D|U>
<From> <To> <Weight>
...
<Source Node>

- `D` = Directed, `U` = Undirected

---

## Notes

- Prim runs only if the graph is undirected.
- Graphs are read from the `/input` folder.
- Source node is specified on the last line of each file.

---

## Files Used

- `graph1.txt` – Undirected
- `graph2.txt` – Undirected
- `graph3.txt` – Undirected
- `graph4.txt` – Directed

---

## How to Run

1. Open in IntelliJ
2. Run `Main.java`
3. View output in the console
